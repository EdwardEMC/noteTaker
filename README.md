# Note Taker

A node.js application to save, display and delete notes.

The user enters on the landing page and can access the note area through the central button.

Once in the note area, the user can see all saved notes and create new ones to be saved, as a new user they will be greeted with an empty display.

To save a note it must have a title and some contents. This contents can be whatever the user desires with all formatting being saved as is. Once the note is complete and saved the title is displayed in the left hand column as a button with a small red trash can icon when clicked on will remove the note from the database.

Clicking anywhere on the title button except for the trash can icon will bring the note up in the display area for the user to read.
